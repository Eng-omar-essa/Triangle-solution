# Triangle Sloution problem. 

# Impelmentation 
To Solve this Issue , I will use Factory Pattern.

# Advantage of Factory Pattern 

-Factory design pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than implementation.

-Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation classes from client code.

- Factory pattern makes our code more robust, less coupled 	and easy to extend. For example, we can easily change PC class implementation because client program is unaware of this.

-Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and client classes through inheritance.

-Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.

-It promotes the loose-coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code. That means the code interacts solely with the resultant interface or abstract class, so that it will work with any classes that implement that interface or that extends that abstract class.

# Usage of Factory Design Pattern

-When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create

-When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.

-When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.
